Describe the bug
A clear and concise description of what the bug is.
Synchronization works initially, but then repeatedly fails. Rich text formatting seemed to initiate the issue, but I'm not sure.
My Nextcloud instance is up and running normally. I can access it via Android or a web browser.
To Reproduce
Steps to reproduce the behavior:
1. Attempt any sync
2. Receive 'Synchronization failed' message.
Expected behavior
Sync as any other app would.

Reasoning:
The bug report has two parts describing the buggy behavior. One is in the reproduction steps section, "Receive Synchronization failed message". The other is the stacktrace at the end.
The first behavior describes that the bug triggered a UI element shown on the screen, which has text 'Synchronization failed'. This can be captured by the DSL as, e=E(desc='Synchronization failed') AND s=S() AND in_screen(e,s).
The second behavior is showing the described log in the device. To verify the log on the device, we only need to retrive the first line indicating the error. This can represented by the DSL as D(log='java.lang.IllegalStateException: Duplicate key 590093').
Therefore, the final output will be the conjunction of two manifestations, using "AND".

Output:
e=E("desc":"Synchronization failed") AND s=S() AND in_screen(e,s) AND d=D("log":"java.lang.IllegalStateException: Duplicate key 590093")
