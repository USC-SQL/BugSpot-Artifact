Input:
I went to Setting and tried to change the language to Franch. However, the app still shows English.

Reasoning:
The report describes a bug causing users unable to change language of the app. As mentioned in the bug report, after changing the settings, the app still shows English words. Therefore, we declare a UI element in the DSL to describe this situation, e=E("desc":"text in English")

Output:
e=E("desc":"text in English") AND s=S() AND in_screen(e,s)
