Other details
Additional details and attachments.

Reasoning:
The bug report describes an issue when the user tried to change the order of mangas, nothing changed on the screen.
In other words, the app is unresponsive. 
Such unresponsiveness also means the UI screens before and after the last reproduction step is the same. 
To describe this in DSL, we define two UI screens s1=S(), s2=S(). We use s1==s2 to represent that they are the same.
We conjunct them to get the final output.

Output:
s1=S() AND s2=S() AND s1==s2
