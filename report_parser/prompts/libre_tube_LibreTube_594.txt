Reasoning:
The buggy behavior is described by the "actual behavior" part of the bug report, as "The miniplayer is glued to the bottom of the screen". 
As being said, the bug displayed a UI element on the screen, with its description as "miniplayer" and location as "bottom of the screen". 
These can be captured by the DSL as e=E(desc="miniplayer") AND s=S() AND in_screen(e,s).

Output:
e=E("desc":"miniplayer") AND s=S() AND in_screen(e,s)
