Input:
The app crashed after I opened the settings.

Reasoning:
The manifestation of this bug is that, the current UI screen shows an app crash. It doesn't have other manifestation. Even it mentioned a UI element "Settings", we don't include this into the DSL expression for this crash bug report.

Output:
s=S("is_crash":True)
