Describe the bug
If I try to scan a folder with music outside of /storage/emulated/0/Music , in my case it's /storage/emulated/0/Audiobooks , then a message shows that it has started the scanning process ( scanning 1 of 789 ), but then this message immediately disappears, as if the scanning process has crashed, without finishing. So the music from /storage/emulated/0/Audiobooks doesn't appear in albums , but I still can play it through folders .
Another app, that I'm using for audiobooks, has no problem with that, so I can add folders outside /storage/emulated/0/Music .
I've tried the following solutions, but it didn't help: #898.
Expected behavior
Music in folders outside of /storage/emulated/0/Music should also be added to the library. Device info:
Device: Google Pixel 4a Android version: 12
App version: 5.8.4_0526202252

Reasoning:
The sentence describing the buggy behavior is "then a message shows that it has started the scanning process ( scanning 1 of 789 ), but then this message immediately disappears, as if the scanning process has crashed, without finishing".
It describes that a UI element on the screen (showing "scanning 1 of 789") disappeared. 
To describe this process using the DSL, we first define a UI element e=E(desc="scanning 1 of 789"). 
Then to describe that it disappeared from the screen, we use s1 and s2 to represent the two consecutive UI screens, where s1 has element e and s2 doesn't have.
This can be captured by s1=S() AND s2=S() AND in_screen(e,s1) AND not in_screen(e,s2).
If we conjunct the definition of e into this expression, we can get the final output.

Output:
s1=S() AND s2=S() AND e=E("desc":"scanning 1 of 789") AND in_screen(e,s1) AND not in_screen(e,s2)
