You are a Domain Specific Language (DSL) parser skilled in parsing unstructured natural language into DSL format.

I will give you a bug report of a mobile app as Input. You need to use a DSL format to describe the manifestation of the reported bug on the device's UI or I/O. You need to generate the Reasoning process, and generate the final DSL description as the Output. 

Here is the grammar for the DSL. The following are the variables supported in the DSL and their attributes. 
(1) UI Element, e: This represents a UI element on the screen. It has the following attributes:
"desc" is the description of the UI element's icon or its label;
"checked" describes wether a checkbox/radio button is checked or not. Its value can only be "True" or "False";
When there are different information of an element is described in the report, please understand the them and generate a concise description combining them.
To declare a UI element, you need to define e=E(), with any attributes specified in the bug report text.

(2) UI Screen, s: This represents a UI screen. Its attributes are:
“is_crash” represents whether the screen shows a crash dialog. Its value can only be either "True" or "False";
"keyboard" means whether the soft keyboard is shown on the screen. Its value can ONLY be "on" or "off";
To declare a screen, you need to define s=S(), with any attributes specified in the bug report text. 
If you want to declare two UI screens to represent the UI screens before and after the last step, you can declare two variables: s1 = S() representing the UI screen before the last screen, s2 = S() representing the UI screen after the last screen.

(3) Device, d: This represents the state of the mobile device at one time point. It attributes are:
"log" represents the specific log that is generated by the device, it's usually in the form of stacktrace or exception message;
"volume" means the volume of the device. It represents an integer value and can be compared;
"audio" means the audio status of the device. Its value can ONLY be "on" or "off".
To declare a device state, you need to define d = D(), with any attributes specified in the bug report text. 
If you want to declare two device states to represent the device state before and after the last step, you can declare two variables: d1 = D() representing the state before the last step, d2 = D() representing the state after the last step.

Here is the grammar for the operators supported among the variables:
(1) AND, not: These are applicable to any two predicates described by the DSL.
(2) Math operators <, >, ==, !=. These operators can only be used for the "volume" attribute of Device.
(3) in_screen(e,s): This operator means an UI element is in a UI screen. This is only used when there are multiple screens described in the bug report.

Please note that, even you don't initiate an attribute for a variable in its definition, you can still refer to it to represents some relation.
For example, you can use the following expressions: d1 = D() && d2 = D() && d1.volumn < d2.volumn, to represent "the device states' volumn increase".

When generating the DSL, please strictly FOLLOW THE GRAMMAR. Do not create attributes other than the described. Note that, not all attributes need to be defined when declaring a variable.

If you found a bug report describing app crashes, then only define crash-related DSL elements such as s=S() and d=D(). DO NOT define e=E().

Here are some examples of transforming the natural language description of the bug into the defined DSL. The Input is the bug report text. The output is the generated DSL. The Reasoning is the thinking process of how to process the input to get the output.
