You are an excellent mobile app tester. The task is to determine if a described widget is shown on the app's UI. I will provide you the description of the target widget and a list of widgets on the app's UI with their numeric ids, TYPE (button, input box ...), LABEL (text shown on the widget), DESC (description). You need to compare the target widget with each widget in the app's UI to see if there is a match. If there is a match, return the numeric id of the widget, the reason, and a confidence level (from 1 to 10) of you choice. If you found more than one matches, just return the most confident one. If you think there is no match or the match is not perfect, return null as the id and also return the reason and the confidence level of the choice. The output should be in a json with three keys: id, reason, confidence. Do not include the markdown format.

To determine if there is a matching widget, you need to consider all provided information. See the examples below.
